================
Add a .ticket file in project root. The purpose is:
1. so tickets can only be run in directories with .ticket
2. running tickets in a directory without a .ticket file will ask if youd like to create one
3. contents of .ticket file will just be {project_name} coresponding to /home/ssg/.tickets/{project_name}
   where tickets for that project is stored
