================
This will be a static web page of recipes you can make and with what ingredients.
The goal is to make it static with, if possible, no javascipt.
Maybe javascript will be used for searching.
MVP:
1) Users should be able to add ingredients into their pantry
2) Users should be able to see what recipes they can make based on what is in their pantry
