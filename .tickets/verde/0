================
Create a rotating IP address pool using mullvad
1. It should use mullvad to set an ip address and send a certain number of calls
2. It should keep track of how many times each IP address was used. Maybe a percentage total
3. It should create a pool of ip address form a file of ip addresses
4. It should retry on failure
